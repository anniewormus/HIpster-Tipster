# The Hipster Tipster Tipping Calculator

### Too often service workers get yelled at, roasted, and left without a tip.
So what do they do about? Well nothing really - except talk crap about you to their co-workers
once you leave, making it so that the next time you show your face in that establishment
not only will you recieve bad service, but there might be an extra little surprise in your
medium rare burger, toasted bun, with extra mayo and onions, side of extra crispy fries.

Don't be that person.

Now with the Hipster Tipster funky fresh tipping calculator, not only will you be appreciated
for doing the bare minimum, but people will be in awe of how cool and smart you are by leaving
your total looking as awesome as you are.

## Twenty percent mode
Let's say the service wasn't stellar. Maybe the person taking care of you seemed lazy, unattentive,
too distracted thinking about their daughters open heart surgury happening tomorrow and how they
are going to afford the hospital bills on minimum wage and tips.

Even though they sucked doesn't mean you have to. With this mode you can calculate a 20% tip and
still sleep at night.
